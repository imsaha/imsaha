### ðŸš€ About me

Hi, Iâ€™m Siraj. Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer at ME Services LLC and I specialize in building enterprise applications with ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and React. I do mobile app development in React Native as a hobby. I like to play around with microservices, system design, and software architecture.
